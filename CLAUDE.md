- This is a basic flashcard management app for internal use of an author team.
- This is an INTERNAL APP. It does not need landing pages, marketing, or lengthy waxing about the glory of flashcards and learning.
- Use latest Django best practices
- Keep code clean and extensible. Functions should be short, side-effect free when possible and do one thing only.
- Keep files short; think of a smart folder/app structure
- Use Poetry for package management.

DO NOT RUN THE FUCKING DEV SERVER!!!!!
